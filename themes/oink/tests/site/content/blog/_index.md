# The index of this section is a card grid; the two child sections keep the row
# form, so one site shows both. The site config turns the reader toggle on
# (ui.blog_index_toggle), so every blog index also carries the toolbar control
# that cycles list, cards, and table.

  # Fumadocs-style section identity: the blog reads through a violet accent
  # while docs keep the default navy. Only the light color is written, so the
  # emitted dark palette pins the lighten-toward-white derivation; one post
  # (featured-wash.md) overrides the color per page.
  theme_color: '#7c3aed'
  # The article info line under each title carries the date always; this
  # switch adds the word count and the minutes beside it.

  # Static intent links plus one local copy button. Nothing is requested until
  # a reader activates one. Thirteen of the sixteen available targets; the other
  # three (reddit, line, pinterest) are named in the theme's hugo.yaml.

Two sections below: the release notes are a numbered series, and the OINK posts
carry bylines resolved from the `authors` taxonomy.
